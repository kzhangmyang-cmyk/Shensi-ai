# Deployment

## Production Docker Compose

The canonical production topology is `deploy/compose.yaml`. It runs four
services on the isolated `shensi_internal` network:

- `mysql` persists the `shensi` database in the `shensi_mysql` named volume.
- `backend` runs the MySQL-backed Express API on port 4188 inside that network.
- `frontend` serves the built Vite assets on port 8080 inside that network.
- `gateway` is the only service with a published port and routes `/api/` to
  `backend`, all other requests to `frontend`, and `/healthz` locally.

The backend is not published to the host. It listens on `0.0.0.0` only so the
internal gateway can reach it; Compose's internal network is its network
boundary. The backend alone also joins the egress-enabled `shensi_egress`
network for approved provider, search, email, and Twilio calls. MySQL,
frontend, and gateway remain only on `shensi_internal`. Production always sets
`NODE_ENV=production` and `CRM_STORE=mysql`; memory/demo persistence is not a
production fallback.

The internal gateway has fixed address `172.30.0.4` on the private
`172.30.0.0/24` network. Compose sets `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS=172.30.0.4/32` for
the backend, so Express trusts only that gateway hop plus loopback. Do not
widen this value or publish a backend port.

### Prerequisites

- Docker Engine with Docker Compose v2.
- The production configuration and the two secret files described below.
- Enough durable storage for the MySQL named volume and backups.
- An HTTPS reverse proxy or load balancer in front of the published gateway
  port when deploying beyond a trusted local network. Set its public origin in
  `CORS_ORIGINS` and keep `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true`.

The images are built from the root pnpm workspace with Node `22.22.3` and run
as non-root users. The current image references are `mysql:8.4.11`,
`node:22.22.3-bookworm-slim`, and
`nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged:1.27-alpine`.

Use `./scripts/deploy` as the canonical production command. It accepts only
MySQL persistence with `CRM_SEED_DEVELOPMENT_DATA=false`, checks
`.env.production.local` has POSIX mode `0600`,
requires the security values and owner-only MySQL secret files, confirms that
the URL-encoded `DATABASE_URL` password and `SHENSI_MYSQL_APP_PASSWORD` agree
with `deploy/secrets/mysql_app_password`, then renders, builds, starts, and
health-checks Compose. It reports service state and public origin only; it
never prints configuration or secret values. Docker Engine/Compose absence is
a hard failure, not a successful deployment. The current execution environment
does not have Docker; see the blocked entry in `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` for
that recorded verification limitation.

### Configuration and secrets

`.env.production.local` and `deploy/secrets/` are ignored and must never be
committed. Start with `.env.example`, copy it to `.env.production.local`, and
replace every placeholder with distinct production values. At minimum, set
the strong session, credential-encryption, job, cursor, claim, and domain
master secrets required by the backend.

Create the MySQL secret files with owner-only permissions. Do not paste the
generated values into shell history, tracked files, or logs.

```bash
umask 077
mkdir -p deploy/secrets
openssl rand -base64 36 | tr -d '\n' > deploy/secrets/mysql_app_password
openssl rand -base64 36 | tr -d '\n' > deploy/secrets/mysql_root_password
```

Set `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.production.local` to a URL whose user is
`shensi_app`, host is `mysql`, port is `3306`, and database is `shensi`. Its
password must be the exact newline-free content of `mysql_app_password`,
URL-encoded for a database URL. Keep strong punctuation in the password;
encode it instead of weakening it. After copying `.env.example`, use this
deterministic command to update `DATABASE_URL` in the ignored production file
without printing the password or its encoded form:

```bash
node -e 'const fs=require("node:fs"); const envPath=".env.production.local"; const password=fs.readFileSync("deploy/secrets/mysql_app_password","utf8"); if (!password || /[\r\n]/.test(password)) throw new Error("MYSQL_APP_PASSWORD_MUST_BE_NEWLINE_FREE"); const url=`mysql://shensi_app:${encodeURIComponent(password)}@mysql:3306/shensi`; const env=fs.readFileSync(envPath,"utf8"); if (!/^DATABASE_URL=.*$/m.test(env)) throw new Error("DATABASE_URL_REQUIRED"); fs.writeFileSync(envPath,env.replace(/^DATABASE_URL=.*$/m,`DATABASE_URL=${url}`));'
```

`SHENSI_HTTP_PORT` is optional and defaults to `8080`.

Set `SHENSI_MYSQL_APP_PASSWORD` in `.env.production.local` to the exact
newline-free content of `deploy/secrets/mysql_app_password`; the wrapper uses
it only for consistency validation and never prints it.

### Deploy and operate

From the repository root, validate the rendered configuration and build/start
the topology:

```bash
./scripts/deploy
```

The gateway health endpoint is `/healthz`; the backend container healthcheck
calls `/api/health`; MySQL is healthy after `mysqladmin ping` succeeds. View
service logs without exposing configuration values:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml --env-file .env.production.local logs --follow --tail=100 gateway backend mysql
```

Stop the Compose deployment while retaining the database volume:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml --env-file .env.production.local down
```

Do not add `--volumes` to a routine stop or rollback command.

### Upgrade, backup, and rollback

Before an upgrade, take and verify an access-controlled backup of the target
`shensi` database. At a minimum, keep a timestamped SQL dump in the ignored
`backups/` directory and verify it can be read by the approved restore
procedure. Encrypt the dump using the approved backup tooling before storing
it outside the deployment host:

```bash
mkdir -p backups
docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml --env-file .env.production.local exec -T mysql \
  sh -c 'mysqldump -uroot -p"$(cat /run/secrets/mysql_root_password)" shensi' \
  > backups/shensi-before-upgrade.sql
```

After the backup, build and start the new images with the deploy command above,
then check gateway, backend, and MySQL health before accepting the upgrade.
For rollback, stop the new containers without removing `shensi_mysql`, return
to the previously approved repository/image revision, and run `up -d` with the
same production configuration. Restore a database backup only under the
separate approved restore/migration procedure; source databases remain
read-only migration inputs.

## Local and Baota entry points

Canonical local development uses the ignored `.env.local` with real MySQL and
the required runtime security keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
./scripts/dev
./scripts/verify
```

The development wrapper reserves `4191` for the API and `5191` for Vite before
starting either process, forces `CRM_STORE=mysql`, and gives Vite
`VITE_API_TARGET=http://127.0.0.1:4191`. `./scripts/verify` runs the context,
contract, backend-build, frontend-test/type/build, and local health gates;
keep the local runtime running while it performs its health checks.

The following root scripts remain useful for focused work:

```bash
pnpm --filter ./backend dev
pnpm --filter ./backend dev:mysql
pnpm --filter ./frontend dev
pnpm setup:mysql:local
pnpm dev:real
```

`pnpm dev:real` uses the ignored `.env.real.local`, MySQL on `127.0.0.1:3307`,
database `shensi_sales`, API port `4188`, and Vite port `5188`. It is not the
production Compose procedure.

`deploy/baota/` remains the existing Linux/Baota package path. Its upgrade
mode uses `REUSE_EXISTING_DATABASE=true`; `REPLACE_DATABASE=true` is a
destructive reset. The package builder requires its external ignored bootstrap
archive and checksum. Do not run destructive installer modes as a verification
shortcut.

## Verification

Deployment-affecting changes require:

```bash
./scripts/context-check
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm test:baota-package
node --test tools/deployment-contract.test.mjs
docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml --env-file .env.example config --quiet
git diff --check
```

MySQL, Chromium, live-provider, Docker build, and running-container checks
need their corresponding local services. A memory-mode test does not prove a
MySQL migration or a production deployment.
